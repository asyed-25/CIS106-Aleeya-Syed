I am taking this class to learn more about coding. While I do have some experience with programming, I want to become more confident in my abilities and understand more through this course. I would like to do something related to computer science or data analytics in the future, so this course will help with setting a foundation for this. The languages I am interested in learning more about are Python and JavaScript and I'm really excited to learn Java as well.
