Problem 2 Pseudo Code:
1. Make variabel to have user input the start value 
	start = int(input(""))
2. Make variable to have the user input the end value
	end = int(input(""))
3. Make variable to have the user input the increment
	increment = = int(input(""))
4. Create a function that passes through the parameters of start, end, & increment
	def numbers(start,end,increment):
5. Make while loop inside the function  
	while numbers == start:
6. Increment the numbers from the beginning
    	start += increment
7. Return the function
   	 return numbers
8. Display the numbers form 1-25
	print(numbers(start,end,increment))



Problem 3 Pseudo Code:
1. Create variable for user to input whether they want to do the program or not
	program = str(input(""))
2. Create if statement for what happens if the user wants to continue
	if program == "Yes":
3. Make while loop inside the if statement describing what happens while the input was Yes
	while program == "Yes":
4. Create variable for user to input their last name in the while loop
	last_name = str(input(""))
5. Create variable for user to input their first exam in the while loop
    exam1 = str(input(""))
6. Create variable for user to input their second exam in the while loop
     exam2 = str(input(""))   
7. Create variable to determine the average of the two exams
      average = sum(exam1 + exam2) / 2
8. Display the last name and the average
     print(last_name, average)   
9. Ask the user if they would like to redo the loop in order to have the loop execute again or not
     loop = str(input(""))
