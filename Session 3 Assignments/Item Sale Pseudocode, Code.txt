Pseudocode/program code that prompts the user for quantity of items and price per item and uses a function to compute the cost (quantity x price per item). 
Use a second function to compute sales tax of 7%. 
Compute total as cost + sales tax. Display quantity, price per item, cost, sales tax, and total.


//Pseudocode
1. Prompt user to input quantity for each item using the input function
	input('')
2. Promt user to input price for each item using the input function
	input('')
3. Use the int and float functions to help with the input
	int(), float()
4. Define what the cost is equal to (how to find the cost)
	cost = 
5. Define how much the sales tax is 
	sales_tax = 
6. Define what the total is equal to (how to find the total)
	total = 
7. Display the quantity, price, cost, sales tax, and total for the items using the print function
	print()



// Program code
item_quant = int(input('How many items are there? ')
item_price = float(input('Put in the price per item: ')
cost = quantity * price

sales_tax = 0.07
total = cost + sales_tax
print(item_quant, item_price, cost, sales_tax, total)
