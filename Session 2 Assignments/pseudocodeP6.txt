Chapter 2 Problem 6 (pseudocode)
Program that helps the user determine how much paint is required to paint a room and how much it will cost.
Ask the user for the length, width, and height of a room, the price of a gallon of paint, and the number of square feet that a gallon of paint will cover. 
Calculate the total area of the four walls as 2 * length * height + 2 * width * height 
Calculate the number of gallons as: total area / square feet per gallon

Input length, width, and height
Input price/paint gallon and number of square feet that a gallon of paint will cover
height = input
width = input
length = input
price = input
squareft = input
area = 2 * length * height + 2 * width * height
gallons = total area / square feet per gallon
Amount of paint is the number of gallons
Cost is the total area * price of a paint gallon
Output cost for x amount of paint
