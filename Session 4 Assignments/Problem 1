//Pseudocode
Create a variable to store the temperature
Design a set of conditions for the temp
If the temp is less than a number, print...
If the temp is less than or equal to a number, print...
If the temp is greater than a number, print...
If the previous conditions aren't met, print...


//Code Implemented
temp = 55

if temp < 20:
    print("It's cold")
elif temp <= 50:
    print("It's nice weather")
elif temp > 80:
    print("It's hot")
else:
    print("It's extremely hot")
