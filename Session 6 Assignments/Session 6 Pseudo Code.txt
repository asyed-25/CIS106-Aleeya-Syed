Problem 2 Pseudo code:
1. Create variable for user to input item quantity
	item_quant = int(input(""))
2. Create vairable for the price per unit
	unitPrice = int(input(""))
3. Make function for the quantity that passes the parameter of quantity
	def quantity(item_quant)
4. Define what occurs if the item_quant is greater than 1000
	if item_quant > 1000:
        unitPrice = 8.00
5. Define what occurs if the item_quant is greater than or equal to 500
	else:
		if item_quant >= 500:
        	unitPrice = 10.00
6. Define what occurs otherwise
        else:
            unitPrice = 12.00
7. Create variable for the extended price
	extendedPrice = item_quant * unitPrice
8. Print the extended price
	print("The extended price for your item(s) is $", extendedPrice)



Problem 3 Pseudocode:
1. Create variable for user to input amount
	amount = input("")
2. Create variable for user to input term
	term = input("")
3. Make function interest_rate that passes through the amount parameter
	def interest_rate(amount)
4. Define what occurs if the amount is greater than or equal to 5 or 10 years
	if float(amount) >= 5 or 10:
        IR = 0.02
5. Define what occurs if the amount is greater than or equal to 1,2, or 3 years
	elif amount >= 1 and 2 and 3:
        IR = 0.01
6. Define what occurs otherwise
	IR = 0.005
7. Return the function
	return IR
8. Call the function
	IR = interest_rate(amount)
9. Display the interest rate and the term


Problem 4 Pseudocode:
1. Create variable for user to input their last name
	last_name = input("")
2. Create variable for user to input their job code
	job_code = input("")
3. Create variable for user to input the number of years
	years = input("")
4. Make function for employee bonus passing through the parameters of job_code and years
	def emp_bonus(job_code, years)
5. Define what occurs if the job code is A and the number of years is >= 10
 if job_code = 'A' and years >= 10:
        bonus = 10000
6. Define what occurs if the job code is A and the number of years is >= 5
  elif job_code = 'A' and years >= 5:
        bonus = 80000
7. Define what occurs if the job code is B and the number of years is >= 15
 elif job_code = 'B' and years >= 15:
        bonus = 9000
8. Define what occurs otherwise
 else:
   	bonus = 5000
9. Return the function
	return bonus
10. Create variable for the bonus
	bonus = emp_bonus(years)
11. Display the last name and bonus
	print(last_name, bonus)
