#Add a function to the problem to display the last name and highest, last name and lowest and average exam score. 
#Hint: for highest initialize a variable to 0 (high_var). 
#If the array value is higher than the high_var then set high_var to the array value 
#and set high_index to the position of the array. Proceed through the array until you get to the end. 
#Do the same for finding the lowest using low_var set to 999 (higher than the highest value). 

#For the average score, sum all the exam scores as you proceed through the loop.
#Use a for loop to go through each occurrence of the arrays.
